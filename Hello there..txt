Hello there.
I've chosen the task documentation 2 image for my task 7 content.
In this task, I involved writing HTML for the structure and CSS for the styling and layout.
Steps taken:

1)HTML Structure
  * I set up the basics with a container, sidebar and content area.
  * Added an animation under "JavaScript Basic tutorials" contents.
  * The content area initially had a welcome message and a "Why learn JavaScript" section and added some extra contents for viewing experience.

2)CSS Styling
  * I styled the page with a clean and readable font, background color and layout.
  * The sidebar was given a fixed width and a light gray background.
  * I added a yellow background to the tutorial title 

I hope that I've matched the image and added some extra content for your viewing experience.
I tried to match the image which is given and I think I've done my best.
If I done any mistakes, please let me know and highlight it.
Thank you.
